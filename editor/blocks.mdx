## Types of Content Blocks

You can store many different types of content on a Monopad page including text, images, videos and embeds.

Monopad works using blocks, where each block represents a different content type.
* The default block in Monopad is text, but there are many other types of blocks.
* Include media like images, and videos inside any Monopad post.
* Advanced blocks include activity routes, results, graphs, metrics and maps.

Blocks can be rearranged and deleted through their More <Icon icon='ellipsis' iconType='solid' /> menu.
